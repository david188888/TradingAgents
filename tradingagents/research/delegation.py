"""Bounded, read-only parallel research delegation.

This module intentionally is not an agent framework.  A Research Manager may
fan out independent, evidence-seeking questions once, through a caller-owned
allowlist of read-only tool callables.  A delegated task receives no executor
and cannot create another task, so the depth limit is enforced by construction
as well as validation.

Only public summaries and citations cross the boundary.  Hidden model
reasoning, prompts, tool traces, and raw provider payloads are deliberately
not fields of the contract and are never persisted here.
