"""Shared helpers for invoking an agent with structured output and a graceful fallback.

The Portfolio Manager, Trader, and Research Manager all follow the same
canonical pattern:

1. At agent creation, wrap the LLM with ``with_structured_output(Schema)``
   so the model returns a typed Pydantic instance. If the provider does
   not support structured output (rare; mostly older Ollama models), the
   wrap is skipped and the agent uses free-text generation instead.
2. At invocation, run the structured call and render the result back to
   markdown. If the structured call itself fails for any reason
   (malformed JSON from a weak model, transient provider issue), fall
   back to a plain ``llm.invoke`` so the pipeline never blocks.

Centralising the pattern here keeps the agent factories small and ensures
all three agents log the same warnings when fallback fires.
